  ## Description
  Note Taker will allow the user to write and save notes.  When the user clicks through the landing page, they are delivered to a notes app.  It will allow them to enter a title and the corresponding text and upon clicking the save button they will be saved to the left hand side of the page.  The user can then click on a note and it will be shown on the main space of the page.
